FINAL PROJECT for COMP2401D
Carleton University, Fall 2023

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:
  fp: A program that simulates four hunters, each with a unique evidence-detecting device, and an evidence-leaving ghost, with the hunters and ghost all independently moving and interacting within a large house. There are four possible variants of ghosts, each having a unique fingerprint of three evidence types combinations.The hunters will win if they can determine which variant the ghost is based on the evidence they can collect, and the ghost will win if the hunters get too scared/bored to do so on time.

LIST OF FILES INCLUDED:
  defs.h
  evidence.c
  ghost.c
  house.c
  hunter.c
  logger.c
  main.c
  Makefile
  README.txt
  room.c
  utils.c

INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPILING:
  IMPORTANT: Make sure you are in a Linux environment with gcc and make installed. This program has not been tested to compile under any other environment.

  1) Make sure you are in the same directory as the files listed under "LIST OF FILES INCLUDED".
  2) Type "make" into your shell and press enter.
  3) You will now have an executable named "fp" in the same directory.

  INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING:
  1) Make sure you are in the same directory as the compiled "fp" binary that you created.
  2) Type "./fp" in your shell and press enter.
  3) The program is now running.

HOW TO USE:
  You will be prompted to enter the name of a hunter four times. Type any names that you would like, and press enter when finished. Then the simulation will begin.

  By default, you will see a log. Each hunter starts in the van, while the ghost will start in a random room other the van. 

  The hunters can either move, attempt to collect evidence or review evidence. Hunters do NOT care whether there is a ghost in the room or not when making a decision.

  Move:
    The hunter will move to a random neighboring room from the room they are in.
  Collect evidence:
    All hunters have a shared evidence pile. If the hunter's device can detect a matching evidence from the room, the evidence will be removed from the room. However, it will only be added to the shared evidence pile if it has not been added yet. This means that only unique evidence types can exist in the shared pile.
  Review evidence:
    The hunter will review evidence to see if it can determine which variant the ghost is. If there is at least 3 different evidence types in the pile, it will have sufficient evidence, and exit, and the hunters will win. Otherwise, the hunter stays in the simulation.

  The ghost can either move, leave evidence, or do nothing. It DOES care whether there is a hunter in the room or not when making decisions.

  Move:
    The ghost will move from the room it is in to a random neighboring room ONLY if there are NO hunters in the room it is currently in.
  Leave evidence:
    The ghost will leave a random type of evidence out of 3 possible evidences its variant can leave. This can be done regardless of whether there is a hunter.
  Do nothing:
    The ghost will simply do nothing. This can be done regardless of whether there is a hunter.

  Observe the log and one will be able to see all the events that happen!
